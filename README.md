# motion_control
This is the work and test enviorment for emotion control.

the `intelliJ` folder is the work enviorment, which is connected to floobits.

the `Eclipse_final` folder is the test enviorment. Changes to motion control code mustn't be made here,
instead you should make the changes in the work enviorment and use `toEclipse.bat` to update the test enviorment.
