# motion_control
This is the work and test enviorment for emotion control.

Plleeeeease commit everytime your code works, also remember to work with branches.

Current team project is APPC. Some relevant information:

1) The current file works
2) The arcs the robot follows are too big for it's own good
3) The robot seems to stop just before entering to the tolerance range for some reason. see issue #11 - APPC Tolerance Unreached for further details.

thanks, xoxo
